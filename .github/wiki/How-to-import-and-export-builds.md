### Instructions Mobalytics

- Go to https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4 to find your build guide.
- Copy the complete url of the build.

Mobalytics uses two different formats

- https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4/builds/druid-pulverize
- https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4/profile/210623d7-d551-492f-82fc-632f760d8751/builds/2c55a596-4d61-4e92-a419-fe738512f27b

For the first variant you need to add the profile page first. Both formats will work.

- https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4/profile/Sanctum
- https://mobalytics.gg/diablo-4/profile/210623d7-d551-492f-82fc-632f760d8751

Copy the url and add the profile. See (3) in the screenshot below. After that you can click on the added profile (1), choose the build you want to add (2), and finally add the selected build (3).

If it looks like the second variant you can skip the profile page and add the build directly after copying the url. See (3) in the screenshot below.
