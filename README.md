Each preset works for both normal and widescreen resolutions. e.g. for 2560x1440 and 3440x1440 use the 1440p preset.

Feel free to share you system presets with me so I can add them to the app.

See the following [wiki](https://github.com/josdemmers/Diablo4Companion/wiki/How-to-create-a-new-System-Preset) page to create your own.
