Feel free to share you system presets with me so I can add them to the app.

See the following [wiki](https://github.com/josdemmers/Diablo4Companion/wiki/How-to-create-a-new-System-Preset) page to create your own.

### Performence

To get a small performance boost you can enable `Lite Mode` in `Settings`. This will combine all weapon types into one making it faster to detect the tooltip.

The `Lite` mode is roughly 100ms faster. However if you want different affixes for weapons, ranged and focus you should turn `Lite Mode` off.

## Usage
